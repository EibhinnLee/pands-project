Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor & Iris-Virginica all have a sample size of 50
Visual display showing Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor & Iris-Virginica all have a sample size of 50
Sepal length v Sepal Width:         Virginica & Versicolor SL/SW seem to be similar length as many overlap unlike the setosa
Sepal length v Petal length:Setosa have a thin cluster of petals compared to other species, more a variable range of sepal lengths also amongst the other variables.
>setosa have quite a narrow range of petals and sepals
Sepal length v Petal Width:sepal length and petal width are more spaced out, setosa range is fairly clustered together
Sepal Width v Sepal length:One of the more decaorated graph's on show, setosa sepal's are wider while the sepal's on the other species are longer
Sepal Width v Petal length:Setosa have a wider range of values but narrow range of lengths of petals and it is the opposite of the other species
Sepal Width v Petal Width:Setosa have a wider range of values but narrow range of width of petals and it is the opposite of the other species
Sepal length v Sepal Width:Setosa's length of petals and sepals are clearly smaller than other species
Petal length v Sepal Width:Virginica and versicolor have longer petals but the setosa while not as long, as more of a wide range of sepals among the sample
Petal length v Petal Width:Both petal variables for setosa are the smallest approx >2cm long & >1cm wide. Both other species are greater than 1 cm width and 3cm long
Petal Width v Sepal length:Some small overlapping between Versicolor and virginica and show larger petals and sepals compared to the setosa
Petal Width v Sepal Width:The Setosa sepal clusters mainly between 3/4 cm but is short at approx 0.5cm while the other species range more than 1 cm
Petal Width v Petal length:Setosa  clearly have the smallest petal length and width, the graph shows a clear difference compared to the other species
Conclusion:There is clear differentiation among species, predominantly the setosa who often finds itself on its own away from the other species.
The virginica and versicolor while show a difference, the likeihood of any species overlapping somewhat would be between those species and not the setosa.
