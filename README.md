Programming and Scripting – Project 2020


Introduction
The project will look at the renowned Fisher’s Iris data-set. In the data-set, I will look at each variable and with the use of Python, present my findings in both a visual and text manner.


Prerequisites
Before commencing, please ensure you have the following requirements
•	Software package (Cmder)
•	Anaconda
•	Windows
•	Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)
•	Iris Dataset

Installing/Getting started
A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a Project 2020 up & running.

Installation
•	Install cmder software package https://cmder.net/
•	Install code editor, visual studio code  https://code.visualstudio.com/
•	Install python https://www.anaconda.com/

Prepare
•	Open cmder
•	Open Visual studio code
•	cd Project_2020
•	cd pands-project

Run code
•	in cmder run code 
•	<python analysis.py>


Running the tests
•	By consistently running the code, I was able to identify what was needed from a visual standpoint and what I could remove.
•	Ultimately the goal of the project was to be able to analyse the given dataset, in this case to make judgement calls of similarities and differences between each species of Iris.
•	Upon each test running, I was able to slightly adapt my needs toward the project. Examples, saving each file in a folder from the code to providing more and more clarity to each graph.


Features
The main features of this project is:
•	To show an ability to construct clear graph’s (scatter and histogram)
•	To be able to use data (iris dataset) in a programming environment
•	To show an understanding of the area.
