Programming and Scripting – Project 2020


Introduction
The project will look at the renowned Fisher’s Iris data-set. In the data-set, I will look at each variable and with the use of Python, present my findings in both a visual and text manner.


Prerequisites
Before commencing, please ensure you have the following requirements
•	Software package (Cmder)
•	Anaconda
•	Windows
•	Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)
•	Iris Dataset

Installing/Getting started
A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a Project 2020 up & running.

Installation
•	Install cmder software package https://cmder.net/
•	Install code editor, visual studio code  https://code.visualstudio.com/
•	Install python https://www.anaconda.com/

Prepare
•	Open cmder
•	Open Visual studio code
•	cd Project_2020
•	cd pands-project

Run code
•	in cmder run code 
•	<python analysis.py>

Dataset Key Findings
• Iris-Setosa
    Often found that this type of species was quite narroe in a range of values
    Examples of this:
      >Sepal width v Petal length scatter plot. The petal length are very narrow and small albeit, the sepal has a longer range in this        case.
      >Sepal length v Petal length scatter plot. The sepal length are quite condensed and even moe so when viewing petal length.
      >Petal length v Petal width. This species of iris has a small range of values for both variables
Key findings: The Iris setosa seems to be quite consistent in length and width. Much more so than the other species of Iris.
              Very rarely overlapped the ranges of other species
              While it has shown to be a smaller version of the iris it would be unfair to assume is alwasy the case. E.g Sepal width.
              
• Iris-Virginica
    Much broader in range comapred to the previous Iris discussed.
    While are more broad range of values, it is often showing the species with the largest length and width
    Examples of this:
      >Sepal length and Petal width show that it separates itself from the other sepcies in these ranges.
      >Petal length has also shown to be the largest in the species 
      >and finally looking at the scatter plot of the Petal length and  petal width , again you can clearly see it shadows the other           iris species.
      
• Iris- versicolor
  Unlike the setosa, it has more of a broad range similar to that of the Virginica.
  Examples of this:
    >Petal length and sepal length show more of a larger range than that of the setosa. 
    >Petal width again shows a vast range 
    >Oftertimes can overlap with the Virginica

Conclusion
From looking at the data:
- The setosa is a more consistent flower with regard to size. Can show narrow ranges on various elements and appears to be over smaller
- Both other species seem to overlap quite a bit in ceratin aspects. Both are seemingly bigger than the setosa overall.
  


Running the tests
•	By consistently running the code, I was able to identify what was needed from a visual standpoint and what I could remove.
•	Ultimately the goal of the project was to be able to analyse the given dataset, in this case to make judgement calls of similarities and differences between each species of Iris.
•	Upon each test running, I was able to slightly adapt my needs toward the project. Examples, saving each file in a folder from the code to providing more and more clarity to each graph.


Features
The main features of this project is:
•	To show an ability to construct clear graph’s (scatter and histogram)
•	To be able to use data (iris dataset) in a programming environment
•	To show an understanding of the area.
